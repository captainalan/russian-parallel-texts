Local Development Notes
-----------------------

If you have Python installed, you can quickly use a web server via,

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

This will start up a server you can access via `http://localhost:8000`.

Without launching a development server, you'll probably get a CORS error as
`fetch` is blocked from accessing your computer's filesystem.
